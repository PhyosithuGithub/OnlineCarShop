            <h3>History of Our Online Shop</h3>
            <p>->This is a Car Online Shop. We developed this website for a half and two months. We want to advertise our products on our own website.
            So we developed this website as soon as possible. Developing website, we have a lot of technical problem skills. but we try
            our best! </p>
            <p>->To get a good and beautiful website or responsive website, we used a lot of languages such as
            HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript, Database like Mysql, Server Side Language named PHP Programming.</p>

            <h3>Background of our Company</h3>
            <p>->We found this company in 1994, it is a small company. At that time, we did not use computerized system like social online.
            we had to use manual system. Using manual system(Not computerized) it not faster to record car information, customer
            information, and it delays to produce total bill. this is wasting of time. It is very impatient to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                ->Finally we got an idea to use something different. Something like our company need to become well-know
                So we advertise on newspaper, on billboard, and through the internet.Using computerized system, customer can order
                our product through online. They can see whatever they want to and wherever they go. You can give their feedback about our online shop.
